README

Project: AlphabetSoupCharity Neural Network

This project builds and optimizes a neural network to predict whether organizations funded by Alphabet Soup will be successful. The models are built using TensorFlow and Keras.

Files:

AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb – Initial preprocessing and baseline model

AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb – Optimized model with three tuning attempts

Neural_Network_Report.txt – Summary of approach, results, and recommendations

To Run: Open the notebooks in Google Colab or Jupyter, run all cells in order. Models are saved automatically.
